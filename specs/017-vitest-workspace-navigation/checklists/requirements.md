## Notes

- Validation passed on first iteration (2026-06-17).
- Testing-infrastructure references (e.g., test directory layout, CI job) appear only where inherent to a verification feature, consistent with feature 010.
- Organization/venue rename form scenarios are explicitly deferred to a future dedicated rename UI feature.
- Event combobox edit/delete coverage is owned by feature 015 and excluded from this feature's scope.
