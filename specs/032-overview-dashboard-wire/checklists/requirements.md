# Specification Quality Checklist: Server-Backed Dashboard Overview and Pin Persistence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] ≥80% test coverage requirement present in functional requirements and success criteria (Constitution III)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation passed on first iteration (2026-06-18).
- FR-013 references a ~30 second freshness window as a behavioral requirement (user-facing responsiveness), not a framework-specific cache setting.
- Out-of-scope widgets (Action Center, Financial Health, Unassigned Transactions) explicitly deferred to SPLR-74/75/76 per Linear dependency graph.
