# Specification Quality Checklist: Montana High Country Design Tokens

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] ≥80% test coverage requirement present in functional requirements and success criteria (Constitution III)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass on initial validation (2026-06-24).
- Spec intentionally scopes to M1 token foundation per SPLR-79; component restyling and typography are deferred to blocked child issues.
- Assumptions section documents CSS custom properties as the implementation approach without prescribing file paths in requirements — acceptable for a design-token feature where the deliverable is inherently a shared value layer.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
